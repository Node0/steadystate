# SteadyState
Transform numbers into narratives and calculations into insights.

`SteadyState` is a reimagining of what it means to track and understand the dynamics of decay, whether that be medicinal half-lives, the dwindling of celestial bodies, multiple samples of radioactive ore all with different half-lives.

`SteadyState` leverages in-browser calculations & charting, providing a tool that's both in-depth and comprehensible. The project stems from a simple idea: to give users the ability to monitor multiple decay streams relative to each other with re-plenishment at the beginning of each half-life i.e. a 'dose' over time with precision and clarity. This is a simple idea that professionals use all the time, however I've never seen a tool like `SteadyState` implemented to visualize such calculations. Which is why I decided to create such a tool.

## Features in Development

- **Multiple Tracks Visualization**: Seamlessly switch between different data sets, each represented by a distinct, customizable line graph.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Input changes lead to immediate visual feedback, with a debounced update mechanism for smooth performance.
- **Dynamic Input Fields**: A non-intrusive interface that presents editable fields for the currently selected track only, keeping the focus clear and the screen uncluttered.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Hover to see precise values, click to edit; an interface that's intuitive on both desktop and mobile.
- **Import/Export Sessions**: Save your progress or share it with others. Your data, when you need it, where you need it.
- **Subtle Styling**: Taking a page from Grafana's book, we aim for a clean, dark-themed UI that's easy on the eyes and keeps the data front and center.
- **Debug Mode**: A hidden gem for those who need it, making troubleshooting as painless as possible.

We're building `SteadyState` with versatility in mind, laying the foundation for a tool that's open ended, hopefully becoming useful across disciplines or use cases.

I hope you like exploring with `SteadyState` as much as I'm enjoying the development of it.
